Project Title:
US Bikeshare Data Analysis


Description:
This project is a Python-based interactive program that analyzes US bikeshare data for three cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The user selects a city, month, and day, and the program filters the data accordingly. It then displays useful statistics such as the most common travel times, most popular stations, trip duration totals and averages. The program also allows users to view the raw data in chunks of five rows at a time.


Files Used:
chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
